        <h2><a href="https://eduhubkmr.pages.dev/blog.html?category=NTA" target="_blank">NEET 2025 Exam Duration and Mode of Examination</a></h2>  
        <p>The National Testing Agency (NTA) has officially clarified the exam pattern and duration for NEET (UG) 2025. Candidates appearing for the exam should note the following important details regarding the mode and time allocated:</p>  
        <ul>  
          <li><strong>Exam Duration:</strong> The total duration of the NEET 2025 exam will be <strong>180 minutes (3 hours)</strong>. This time includes answering all questions across Physics, Chemistry, and Biology sections.</li>  
          <li><strong>Mode of Examination:</strong> NEET 2025 will be conducted in a <strong>Pen and Paper (Offline OMR-based)</strong> mode, meaning candidates will mark their answers on an OMR sheet.</li>  
          <li><strong>Exam Shift:</strong> The exam will be held in a <strong>single shift</strong> to maintain uniformity and streamline the process nationwide.</li>  
        </ul>  
        <p>This announcement by the NTA confirms that there will be no online or computer-based test for NEET 2025, which aligns with the traditional paper-based approach followed in recent years.</p>  
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Candidates should familiarize themselves with the OMR marking scheme and practice accordingly to avoid errors during the actual examination.</p>  
        <p>It is recommended to check the official NTA website regularly for any further updates or instructions related to exam day guidelines, admit card release, and COVID-19 protocols, if applicable.</p>
